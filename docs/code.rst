The generator does not write any code for you, but it will generate an empty
package or module based on your choice. The tests directory will be created
for you, but you'll need to add the first test.

This sample project has a single-file module (``project_template.py`` `ðŸ”—`__)
and one test (``test_greeting.py`` `ðŸ”—`__).

There is a Pylint configuration_ in ``.pylintrc`` `ðŸ”—`__. Its settings are
documented there_. To learn how to enable, disable, or configure Pylint's
diagnostics, consult the documentation on `message control`_ or take a look at
