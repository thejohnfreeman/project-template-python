Dependencies
============

This project manages dependencies through ``pyproject.toml`` `ðŸ”—`__, a Python
package metadata file working its way to standardization through `PEP 518`_.
``pyproject.toml`` stands to replace a growing, redundant, confusing set of
configuration files: ``setup.py``, ``requirements.txt``, ``setup.cfg``,
``MANIFEST.in``, and ``Pipfile``.

Poetry
------

Right now, the premier tool for managing ``pyproject.toml`` is Poetry_. The
generator requires you to have Poetry installed and has instructions_ in its
documentation for installing it.

.. _Poetry: https://github.com/sdispater/poetry#introduction
.. _instructions: https://github.com/thejohnfreeman/generator-python#install

If you're familiar with npm_ or Yarn_, Poetry works much the same way.
Poetry will create a virtual environment for your project and install your
project's dependencies there, isolated from the virtual environments of other
projects.

By default, Poetry will create your virtual environment underneath a cache
directory in your home directory, ``$HOME/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs``. You
can find this directory by checking your Poetry configuration::

   $ poetry config settings.virtualenvs.path

You can configure Poetry to create the virtual environment in your project
directory, if you want::

   $ poetry config settings.virtualenvs.in-project true

The in-project virtual environment directory will be named ``.venv``.


Managing dependencies
---------------------

When you run the generator, it will install the starting dependencies, but if
you clone this project, you must install them yourself::

   $ poetry install

.. _npm: https://medium.com/beginners-guide-to-mobile-web-development/introduction-to-npm-and-basic-npm-commands-18aa16f69f6b
.. _Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/

Dependencies are grouped. The two most common groups are **required**
(dependencies your code uses at runtime) and **development** (dependencies
your project uses for development, e.g. ``mypy`` or ``pytest``).
You can add or remove dependencies easily::

   $ poetry add requests
   $ poetry remove --dev mypy

By default, Poetry will search the `Python Package Index (PyPI)`__ for the
latest versions of the dependencies you name. To find out how to search other
package repositories or how to search for specific versions, consult the
`Poetry documentation`__.

Default dependencies
--------------------

By default, the generator does not install any required dependencies, but it
does install a set of development dependencies, explained here.
