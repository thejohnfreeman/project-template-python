License
=======

The license for this project is the `Internet Systems Consortium (ISC)
license`__.
It is functionally equivalent to the simplified BSD and MIT licenses, but
without language deemed unnecessary following the Berne Convention.

ISC is the default just because it is my favorite permissive license.
I would like to offer a choice of popular licenses if it is easy.
I tried composing the `most popular generator for licenses`__, but it is
impossible__ to get the value of the choice returned to ``generator-python``
for writing the package metadata file.
I don't plan on expending the effort to add a license prompt unless it becomes
clear it is holding back many new users, but I welcome a `pull request`__ to
add it.

If you want a different license, just drop it into the file ``LICENSE`` `ðŸ”—`__
and edit the ``license`` setting in ``pyproject.toml`` `ðŸ”—`__. If you don't
know what license you want, the wizard at choosealicense.com_ can help you
pick one.
